  > 1. Add the original repository as a remote
  > ```bash
  > git remote add upstream
  > ```
  > 2. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master.
  > ```bash
  > git fetch upstream
  > ```
  > 3. Check out your fork's local master branch.
  > ```bash
  > git checkout master
  > ```
  > 4. Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.

  > git merge upstream/master
  > ```
  > 5. Push the changes to your fork
  > ```bash
  > git push origin master
  > ```
